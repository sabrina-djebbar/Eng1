Eng1 Project - York Pirates! developed by SconeZone
===================================================
Desciption
----------
**York Pirates** is a [libGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/)-based game 
which is designed around the Eng 1 product brief.
So far the following features have added:
 - Sailing across the Lake of York
 - Combat with colleges
 
 LibGDX
 ------
 LibGDX is an Open Source framework that we used to develop York Pirates!
 I recommend looking at [A Simple Game](https://libgdx.com/wiki/start/a-simple-game)
 which the college combat is based on.
 The [wiki](https://libgdx.com/wiki/) is the place to go if you need help understanding things like the TileMap system.
 
Building and Deployment
-----------------------
I recommend using the Android Studio or Eclipse methods for running the projet seen
[here](https://libgdx.com/wiki/start/import-and-running).
You can build the project using the export functions in Android Studio, Eclipse.

You can also use gradles system in which the steps should be:
1. Clone the git\
`git clone https://github.com/sabrina-djebbar/Eng1.git`
2. Navigate into root directory\
`cd Eng1`
3. Run the build script\
`gradlew desktop:dist` (try adding `./` at the start is that doesnt work.)
4. You're done! The generated files are under `desktop/build/libs/*.jar`
